# Pocket-Therapist
Pocket-Therapist attempts to fight a mental health crisis: control over emotions, by taking a self-tracking and self-regulating approach to mental health. Users learn to tune their emotions with an Android application that will provide mood tracking and correlation. Other features include: journaling, time-tracking, organization, and tagging. Tagging is a custom mark that adds a user-defined characteristic to an entry allowing organization, time tracking, and correlation. If time permits, collaboration with therapists and psychologists of the users’ choosing will be included in the future.

By using the Pocket-Therapist app, users will learn the necessary skills of mood management and behavioral change needed in all parts of their life without having to rely on outside influences to teach them. As users document their behavior, they will be able to reflect on past entries, seeing their change of behavior and will be able to properly plan in the future what they would like to achieve. Pocket-Therapist will give an increasing return value the more the user puts in, encouraging the user to reform their behavior on their own will, supporting an improving healthy lifestyle.  

# Motivation
Our research has shown that mental health apps can in fact be an effective therapeutic tool. The first two articles provide a set of needs that an effective mental health app would need to fulfill, as well as guidelines on how such an app can help users to make behavioral changes. The final article determines what therapeutic techniques are under utilized by the mental health app market and suggests how such apps could be used for each technique.
